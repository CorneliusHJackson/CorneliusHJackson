- 👋 Hi, I’m Cornelius H. Jackson.
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science and Data Engineering.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Science and Machine Learning: Making Data-Driven Decisions as taught by MIT Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS).
- 🎓 I have completed the IBM Data Science Specialization program (https://coursera.org/share/63a9cbc2ebe86d38a8d10650f9cf0afe) and the Neural Networks and Deep Learning course (https://coursera.org/share/d955897253046f8b24829eefa3153067) offered by Coursera.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a Machine Learning algorithm for patent examination, as I am a former patent examiner.
- 📫 You can reach me at cornelius_jackson@hotmail.com.
